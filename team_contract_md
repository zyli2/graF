# Team Contract

## Communication
**1. Team Meetings** 

We will meet as often as needed (we will adjust the time commitment based on the project). Most likely we will be meeting every week to check the progress from each group member. Each meeting should take at least 30 minutes. We will use either Discord and Zoom for online meetings, or we will meet in person if all group members are available. Every week we will have one member taking meeting minutes for the meeting.


**2. Assistance** 

We will contact each other through the discord group chat. Within two days we should respond.
If any one of us needs to contact someone immediately, then he can call or text the person (faster).
If any one of us has ideas about future developments, we can record and discuss them in the next meeting.

**3. Respect** 

We will make sure to listen to everyone's opinions. We should also make sure everyone is on board with any ideas that we put forth. We should try our best to understand each other's issues and make sure we evenly distribute work so that we can all participate.


## Collaboration

**4. Work Distribution** 

We will all take part in developing the algorithm for our project. This includes brainstorming ideas and researching subjects we're unfamiliar about. To distribute the actual implementation of our algorithm, we will evenly divide the work by difficulty. For instance, a person may do 2 medium difficulty functions and another person may do a difficult function and an easy one. 
    
On a side note, if a person needs a lot of help, everyone should take responsibility in helping that person.
    
**5. Time Commitment** 

We will each spend a minimum of 3 hours per week. We should account for the MP's and other classes we are taking. We will communicate and clarify any points through meetings if necessary.


**6. Conflict Resolution** 

We will communicate with each other when there's a conflict. If a member fails to finish the assigned work on time, we will first ask if he needs extra help from others. However, if a member fails to meet the target too many times in a row without prior notice, the other members have the right to inform the course staff for further actions.
